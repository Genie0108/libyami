Libyami 0.1 release note
Libyami is core video library to accelerate decoding/encoding based on libva.
Libyami can be treated as development kit for VAAPI. It is developed by C++ language, with simple/efficient APIs, without external dependencies.
libyami targets two type of usage:
    - Hardware accelerated codec is the major gap (there is existing media framework ), for example: Chromeos/Android, maybe ffmpeg.
    - Usage is simple enough that codec is the major interest, for example: remote desktop client/server, video surveillance.
So far H.264 decode/encode, VP8 and JPEG decode are supported. VP8/JPEG encode support is under development.

There are rich tests/examples in yami for a try. The tests can run without Window system (X11/Wayland etc),
some modes of video output are supported: including raw data dump and some modes of texture (TFP, drm flink name, dma_buf).

More details see: https://github.com/01org/libyami/wiki

Known issues:
    some jpeg file similarity <0.99 (~0.98) after decoding

    playback performance through gst-omx is not good:

The future release plan are:
    Nov: v0.11: V4L2 VDA/VEA
    Dec: v0.2
        Vp8 and jpeg encoder(depends on driver release)
        unified input/output buffer of yami
    Feb'15: v0.3
        Vp9 decoder
        transcoding support with unified input/output buffer
        camera dma_buf support, camera with jpeg input
        use yami in ffmpeg for hw codec

    Future:
        h265 decoder
        legacy codec: mpeg2 decoder/encoder, vc1 decoder, mpeg4/h263 decoder/encoder
