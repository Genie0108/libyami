Testing
-------

Unit Tests

  The gtest framework library <https://github.com/google/googletest> is required
  in order to write and compile unit tests in libyami.  The gtest project does
  not recommend using a pre-compiled gtest package, unfortunately.  So you will
  need to compile the gtest library from source.  The latest release can be
  downloaded from the release archive at:

    <https://github.com/google/googletest/releases>

  The gtest documentation can be found in their source tree under `docs` (online
  or in the downloaded source archive).

  To enable the unit tests, when configuring libyami you need to specify:

    --enable-gtest=${GTEST_DIR}

  where ${GTEST_DIR} is the path to where you compiled the gtest library.

Review process
--------------
  Create pull requests at <https://github.com/01org/libyami/compare>

  We highly recommend that unit tests accompany your contributed patches.  See
  "Testing" section above.  However, we do understand that not everything can
  be tested by a unit test. So use your best judgement to determine if a unit
  test is appropriate for your contribution.  The maintainer(s) reserve the
  right to refuse submission's without unit tests, when reasonable, or if a
  submission causes existing unit tests to regress.
