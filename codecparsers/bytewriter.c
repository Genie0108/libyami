 *
 * #ByteWriter provides a byte writer and reader that can write/read different
 * integer and floating point types to/from a memory buffer. It provides functions
 * for writing/reading signed/unsigned, little/big endian integers of 8, 16, 24,
 * 32 and 64 bits and functions for reading little/big endian floating points numbers of
 * 32 and 64 bits. It also provides functions to write/read NUL-terminated strings
 * in various character encodings.
