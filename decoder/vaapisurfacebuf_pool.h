/**
 * \class VaapiSurfaceBufferPool
 * \brief surface pool used for decoding rendering
 * <pre>
 * 1. the surface status is described by 3 bitwise flag: | SURFACE_RENDERING | SURFACE_TO_RENDER | SURFACE_DECODING |
 *      SURFACE_DECODING is set when the buffer is used for decoding, usually set when decoder create a new #VaapiPicture.
 *      SURFACE_DECODING is cleared when decoder doesn't use the buffer any more, usually when decoder delete the corresponding #VaapiPicture. 
 *      SURFACE_TO_RENDER is set when #VaapiPicture is ready to output (VaapiPicture::output() is called).
 *      SURFACE_TO_RENDER is cleared when VASurface is sent to client for rendering (VaapiDecoderBase::getOutput())
 *      SURFACE_RENDERING is set when VASurface is sent to client for rendering (VaapiDecoderBase::getOutput())
 *      SURFACE_RENDERING is cleared when the surface is returned back from client (VaapiDecoderBase::renderDone())
 *  if no flag is set, the buffer/surface can be reused -- associate with a new VaapiPicture
 * 2. the free surface is in a first-in-first-out queue to be friendly to graphics fence
 * 3. the output surface buffer will be managed by a queue (not done yet). (now, it depends on timestamp/poc for output order)
